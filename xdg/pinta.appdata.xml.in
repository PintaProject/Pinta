        <ul>
          <li>Added a tab view to switch between images. The tabs can
          also be docked side-by-side or pulled into new
          windows. (#94).</li>
          <li>The Rotate / Zoom dialog now supports zooming and
          panning (#1252756).</li>
          <li>Added a Smooth Erase tool, which is enabled using the
          Type menu on the Erase tool's toolbar (#110).</li>
          <li>The Pencil tool can switch between different blend modes
          (#124, #1688743).</li>
          <li>Added support for JASC PaintShop Pro palette files
          (#126).</li>
          <li>The transform tools can now rotate in fixed increments
          by holding Shift (#134).</li>
          <li>The Move Selected tool can now scale by holding Ctrl
          (#138).</li>
          <li>Dragging and dropping a URL (e.g. image from a web
          browser) to download and open the image is now supported
          (#80, #644123).</li>
          <li>Performance improvements when interacting with
          selections, particularly for large images (#1428740).</li>
          <li>The Rectangle Select tool now shows different arrow
          cursors at each corner of the selection (#1188143).</li>
          <li>A new user guide has been written for the Pinta website!
          Thanks to @jeneira94, @akaro2424, and @anadvu for their
          contributions!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Changes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>UI improvements to the New Image dialog (#99,
          [1424547).</li>
          <li>The Rotate / Zoom dialog now rotates in-place instead of
          changing the layer's size.</li>
          <li>Cairo blend operations are now used instead of PDN's
          managed blend modes (#98, #1248933, #1091910).</li>
          <li>The tool windows can now only be closed with the View ->
          Tool Windows menu, as it was easy to accidentally close them
          without knowing how to recover them (#1428720).</li>
          <li>The shortcut for the Intersect selection mode is now Alt
          + Left Click instead of using Shift, which had caused
          conflicts with holding Shift to constrain the selection to a
          square (#1426660).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes</p>

          tools (#1452607).</li>
          <li>The option to expand the canvas when pasting an image
          now only changes the canvas size in the dimension where the
          pasted image is larger (#1883623).</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug where Auto Crop used the current layer
          instead of the entire image when deciding what to crop, and
          takes the selection into account (#1434928, #1434906).</li>
          <li>Fixed potential crashes when switching tools without any
          open documents (#1425612).</li>

          premultiplied alpha (#109, #113, #114, #117, #125).</li>
          <li>Corrected display problems in the Move Selected Tool and
          live previews for effects (#115).</li>
          <li>Add-ins can now load icons correctly (#116).</li>
          <li>Fixed strange behaviour when the width or height of a
          drawn rounded rectangle is 0 (#112).</li>

          background palette color to the foreground color
          (#1888131).</li>
          <li>Fixed issues where the zoom level was not maintained
