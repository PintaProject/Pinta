          <li>The brush size and line width settings for many tools can now be adjusted with the `[` and `]` keyboard shortcuts (#796, #1155)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Changes</p>
        <ul>

          <li>Fixed a potential crash on some platforms when entering characters in the text tool using an input method (#722)</li>
          <li>The angle picker widget now supports fractional angles (#807)</li>
          <li>Fixed issues with restoring saved settings in the Eraser tool (#839)</li>

          <li>For Linux users, webp-pixbuf-loader is now a suggested dependency to enable WebP support in Pinta</li>

          <li>Pinta now always saves files to the exact file name chosen by the native file dialog, without e.g. appending a default extension. This fixes issues where files saved through desktop portals could be lost (#1958670)</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug where an empty dash pattern resulted in nothing being drawn (#1973706)</li>
          <li>Fixed issues where certain dash patterns did not draw correctly (#1959032)</li>

        <p>Changes</p>

          [1424547).</li>

          <li>The shortcut for the Intersect selection mode is now Alt
