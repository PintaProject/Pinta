- Added a tab view to switch between images. The tabs can also be docked side-by-side or pulled into new windows. (#94).
- The Rotate / Zoom dialog now supports zooming and panning ([#1252756](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1252756)).
- Added a Smooth Erase tool, which is enabled using the Type menu on the Erase tool's toolbar (#110).
- The Pencil tool can switch between different blend modes (#124, [#1688743](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1688743)).

### Changed
- .NET 4.5 / Mono 4.0 are now required.
- Mono 6.x is strongly recommended for [Mac](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-mac) and [Linux](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1877235) users.
- UI improvements to the New Image dialog (#99, [[1424547](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1424547)).
