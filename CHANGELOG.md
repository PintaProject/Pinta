## [Unreleased](https://github.com/PintaProject/Pinta/compare/2.0.1...HEAD)

Thanks to the following contributors who worked on this release:
- @cameronwhite
- @jpobst

### Added
- Updated icons to symbolic SVG icons, which are more usable for dark themes and high-res screens (#204, #207, [#1738106](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1738106), [#1909573](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1909573))
- Added "Transparency Mode" to the Gradient tool
- Improved canvas rendering performance (#209, #210)
- Improved support for `.ora` files
  - Hidden layers are now round-tripped correctly for `.ora` files ([#1377566](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1377566))
  - When saving a `.ora` file, a flattened image (`mergedimage.png`) is now included in the archive. This is required by the spec to accomodate viewer software ([#1377566](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pinta/+bug/1377566))

### Changed
- Pinta now uses the standard GTK about dialog

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where the default linear gradient was reflected rather than clamped.

- The history panel is now more readable when a dark theme is used (#207)
- Fixed an issue where the Cairo surface for live effect previews was not always disposed (#206)

### Fixed
- Fixed a missing file (`installer/linux/install.proj`) from the release tarball that caused the `install` build step to fail
